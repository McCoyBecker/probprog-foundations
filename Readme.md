# Introduction

This will be setup very similar to the [awesome-courses](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/blob/master/README.md) repo, which you should also definitely checkout! I've tried to also include resources like research groups and conferences. Probabilistic programming and machine learning are tightly interwoven, so it's unlikely that I've done a great job of identifying all possible groups or resources with a probabilistic programming element. If you find something and would like to contribute, copy the styling and submit a pull request.

### Reference format
When referencing courses, I'm include meta-information like: institute, professor, course number, course title, year, and probabilistic programming framework used in the course.

When referencing textbooks, I'm including first author and year.

## Courses

### Probabilistic programming

##### Blurb: Course which (mostly) cover topics which are foundational to probabilistic programming. These topics include: interpretation of languages, constructing inference engines, and expressing models.

[UBC (Frank Wood), PPAML Summer School, 2016, **Anglican**](http://probmods.github.io/ppaml2016/)  
PPAML was a DARPA BAA from 2016 which spawned a lot of research on probabilistic programming languages. Anglican is a probabilistic programming language embedded in Clojure. The course covers modeling agents with probabilistic programs, approximate inference algorithms, and data analysis.

[UBC (Frank Wood), Graduate course in probabilistic programming, **Anglican**](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS532W-539W/)  
A course which follows the structure of the [Jan-Willem text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10756) closely. Students build an interpreter for a first-order language (i.e. no recursion). Students then build a compiler to produce graphical models (think: Bayesian networks) as well as an inference engine for graphical models. Students also build a small autodiff engine, before moving on to higher-order languages.

[KAIST (Hongseok Yang), CS492, Probabilistic Programming, **Anglican**](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/probprog17)   
This course has two goals. The first is to help students to be a good user of an expressive probabilistic programming language. Throughout the course, we will use a particular language, called Anglican, but we will emphasise general principles that apply to a wide range of existing probabilistic programming systems. The second goal is to expose the students to recent exciting results in probabilistic programming, which come from machine learning, statistics, programming languages, and probability theory. Through a group project, students will be given a chance to study such a result and to play with it.This course has two goals.

[NEU (Jan-Willem van de Meent), CS 7140, Advanced Machine Learning, **Any**](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jwvdm/teaching/cs7140/spring2019/)  
A course which covers classical techniques in Bayesian reasoning and analysis, as well as generative modeling techniques from deep learning. This course looks incredibly rich and fun!

[Goodman, Stuhlmuller: Design and Implementation of Probabilistic Programming Languages, **WebPPL**](http://dippl.org/)  
An online course which covers the implementation of the WebPPL language, which is embedded in JavaScript. Covers inference engine techniques like enumerative inference using continuations, as well as approximate inference.

[Goodman, Tenenbaum, et al: Probabilistic Models of Cognition, **WebPPL**](https://probmods.org/)  
An online course which covers probabilistic programming in the context of cognitive science.

### Programming language theory

##### Blurb: Courses which cover topics outside the purview of "pure" probabilistic programming but have a significant impact on language design. These topics include: interpretation of languages, language abstractions, and metaprogramming.

### Bayesian reasoning

##### Blurb: Courses which cover topics concerning classical Bayesian reasoning. These topics include: graphical models, exponential families, exact and approximate inference techniques, variational inference methods, foundations of probability, and more.
